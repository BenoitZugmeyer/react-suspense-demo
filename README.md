# React Suspense demo

This is an implementation of the demo shown by Gaearon in his [talk at JSConf
Iceland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6iR3Zk4oDY).  It uses *unstable* features available in
the current React release.

You can try the demo [here](http://benoitzugmeyer.github.io/react-suspense-demo/).
