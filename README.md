# React Suspense demo

This is an implementation of the demo shown by Gaearon in his [talk at JSConf
Iceland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6iR3Zk4oDY).  It uses the Acdlite branch from his [pull
request](https://github.com/facebook/react/pull/12279) to implement React Suspense.

Please note that the `Loader` component has already been removed from the pull request, so I didn't
use it here.

You can try the demo [here](http://benoitzugmeyer.github.io/react-suspense-demo/).

PS: also I wanted to try Webpack 4 and Babel 8 (beta).  Pretty nice stuff.
